THE BATTLE OF LUNDY'S LANE
</p>

Rufus Gale speaks&#8212;1852
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Yes,&#8212;in the Lincoln Militia,&#8212;in the war of eighteen-twelve;
</p>
<p>
Many's the day I've had since then to dig and delve&#8212;
</p>
<p>
But those are the years I remember as the brightest years of all,
</p>
<p>
When we left the plow in the furrow to follow the bugle's call.
</p>
<p>
Why, even our son Abner wanted to fight with the men!
</p>
<p>
&#34;Don't you go, d'ye hear, sir!&#34;&#8212;I was angry with him then.
</p>
<p>
&#34;Stay with your mother!&#34; I said, and he looked so old and grim&#8212;
</p>
<p>
He was just sixteen that April&#8212;I couldn't believe it was him;
</p>
<p>
But I didn't think&#8212;I was off&#8212;and we met the foe again,
</p>
<p>
Five thousand strong and ready, at the hill by Lundy's Lane.
</p>
<p>
There as the night came on we fought them from six to nine,
</p>
<p>
Whenever they broke our line we broke their line,
</p>
<p>
They took our guns and we won them again, and around the levels
</p>
<p>
Where the hill sloped up&#8212;with the Eighty-ninth,&#8212;we fought like devils
</p>
<p>
Around the flag;&#8212;and on they came and we drove them back,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Until with its very fierceness the fight grew slack.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
It was then about nine and dark as a miser's pocket,
</p>
<p>
When up came Hercules Scott's brigade swift as a rocket,
</p>
<p>
And charged,&#8212;and the flashes sprang in the dark like a lion's eyes;
</p>
<p>
The night was full of fire&#8212;groans, and cheers, and cries;
</p>
<p>
Then through the sound and the fury another sound broke in&#8212;
</p>
<p>
The roar of a great old duck-gun shattered the rest of the din;
</p>
<p>
It took two minutes to charge it and another to set it free.
</p>
<p>
Every time I heard it an angel spoke to me;
</p>
<p>
Yes, the minute I heard it I felt the strangest tide
</p>
<p>
Flow in my veins like lightning, as if, there, by my side,
</p>
<p>
Was the very spirit of Valor. But 'twas dark&#8212;you couldn't see&#8212;
</p>
<p>
And the one who was firing the duck-gun fell against me
</p>
<p>
And slid down to the clover, and lay there still;
</p>
<p>
Something went through me&#8212;piercing&#8212;with a strange, swift thrill;
</p>
<p>
The noise fell away into silence, and I heard as clear as thunder
</p>
<p>
The long, slow roar of Niagara: O the wonder
</p>
<p>
Of that deep sound. But again the battle broke
</p>
<p>
And the foe, driven before us desperately&#8212;stroke upon stroke,
</p>
<p>
Left the field to his master, and sullenly down the road
</p>
<p>
Sounded the boom of his guns, trailing the heavy load
</p>
<p>
Of his wounded men and his shattered flags, sullen and slow,
</p>
<p>
Setting fire in his rage to Bridgewater mills and the glow
</p>
<p>
Flared in the distant forest. We rested as we could,
</p>
<p>
And for a while I slept in the dark of a maple wood:
</p>
<p>
But when the clouds in the east were red all over,
</p>
<p>
I came back there to the place we made the stand in the clover;
</p>
<p>
For my heart was heavy then with a strange deep pain,
</p>
<p>
As I thought of the glorious fight, and again and again
</p>
<p>
I remembered the valiant spirit and the piercing thrill;
</p>
<p>
But I knew it all when I reached the top of the hill,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
For there, there with the blood on his dear, brave head,
</p>
<p>
There on the hill in the clover lay our Abner&#8212;dead!&#8212;
</p>
<p>
No&#8212;thank you&#8212;no, I don't need it; I'm solid as granite rock,
</p>
<p>
But every time that I tell it I feel the old, cold shock,
</p>
<p>
I'm eighty-one my next birthday&#8212;do you breed such fellows now?
</p>
<p>
There he lay with the dawn cooling his broad fair brow,
</p>
<p>
That was no dawn for him; and there was the old duck-gun
</p>
<p>
That many and many's the time,&#8212;just for the fun,
</p>
<p>
We together, alone, would take to the hickory rise,
</p>
<p>
And bring home more wild pigeons than ever you saw with your eyes.
</p>
<p>
Up with Hercules Scott's brigade, just as it came on night&#8212;
</p>
<p>
He was the angel beside me in the thickest of the fight&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Wrote a note to his mother&#8212;He said, &#34;I've got to go;
</p>
<p>
Mother what would home be under the heel of the foe!&#34;
</p>
<p>
Oh! she never slept a wink, she would rise and walk the floor;
</p>
<p>
She'd say this over and over, &#34;I knew it all before!&#34;
</p>
<p>
I'd try to speak of the glory to give her a little joy.
</p>
<p>
&#34;What is the glory to me when I want my boy, my boy!&#34;
</p>
<p>
She'd say, and she'd wring her hands; her hair grew white as snow&#8212;
</p>
<p>
And I'd argue with her up and down, to and fro,
</p>
<p>
Of how she had mothered a hero, and his was a glorious fate,
</p>
<p>
Better than years of grubbing to gather an estate.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I'd put it this way: &#34;If God was to say to me now
</p>
<p>
'Take him back as he once was helping you with the plow,'
</p>
<p>
I'd say, 'No, God, thank You kindly; 'twas You that he obeyed;
</p>
<p>
You told him to fight and he fought, and he wasn't afraid;
</p>
<p>
You wanted to prove him in battle, You sent him to Lundy's Lane,
</p>
<p>
'Tis well!&#34; But she only would answer over and over again,
</p>
<p>
&#34;Give me back my Abner&#8212;give me back my son!&#34;
</p>
<p>
It was so all through the winter until the spring had begun,
</p>
<p>
And the crocus was up in the dooryard, and the drift by the fence was thinned,
</p>
<p>
And the sap drip-dropped from the branches wounded by the wind,
</p>
<p>
And the whole earth smelled like a flower,&#8212;then she came to me one night&#8212;
</p>
<p>
&#34;Rufus!&#34; she said, with a sob in her throat,&#8212;&#34;Rufus, you're right.&#34;
</p>
<p>
I hadn't cried till then, not a tear&#8212;but then I was torn in two&#8212;
</p>
<p>
There, it's all right&#8212;my eyes don't see as they used to do!
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But O the joy of that battle&#8212;it was worth the whole of life,
</p>
<p>
You felt immortal in action with the rapture of the strife,
</p>
<p>
There in the dark by the river, with the flashes of fire before,
</p>
<p>
Running and crashing along, there in the dark, and the roar
</p>
<p>
Of the guns, and the shrilling cheers, and the knowledge that filled your heart
</p>
<p>
That there was a victory making and you must do your part,
</p>
<p>
But&#8212;there's his grave in the orchard where the headstone glimmers white:
</p>
<p>
We could see it, we thought, from our window even on the darkest night;
</p>
<p>
It is set there for a sign that what one lad could do
</p>
<p>
Would be done by a hundred hundred lads whose hearts were stout and true.
</p>
<p>
And when in the time of trial you hear the recreant say,
</p>
<p>
Shooting his coward lips at us, &#34;You shall have had your day:
</p>
<p>
For all your state and glory shall pass like a cloudy wrack,
</p>
<p>
And here some other flag shall fly where flew the Union Jack,&#34;&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Why tell him a hundred thousand men would spring from these sleepy farms,
</p>
<p>
To tie that flag in its ancient place with the sinews of their arms;
</p>
<p>
And if they doubt you and put you to scorn, why you can make it plain,
</p>
<p>
With the tale of the gallant Lincoln men and the fight at Lundy's Lane.=

SPRING ON MATTAGAMI
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Far in the east the rain-clouds sweep and harry,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Down the long haggard hills, formless and low,
</p>
<p>
Far in the west the shell-tints meet and marry,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Piled gray and tender blue and roseate snow;
</p>
<p>
East&#8212;like a fiend, the bolt-breasted, streaming
</p>
<p class="i2">
Storm strikes the world with lightning and with hail;
</p>
<p>
West&#8212;like the thought of a seraph that is dreaming,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Venus leads the young moon down the vale.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Through the lake furrow between the gloom and bright'ning
</p>
<p class="i2">
Firm runs our long canoe with a whistling rush,
</p>
<p>
While Pot&#224;n the wise and the cunning Silver Lightning
</p>
<p class="i2">
Break with their slender blades the long clear hush;
</p>
<p>
Soon shall I pitch my tent amid the birches,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Wise Pot&#224;n shall gather boughs of balsam fir,
</p>
<p>
While for bark and dry wood Silver Lightning searches;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Soon the smoke shall hang and lapse in the moist air.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Soon shall I sleep&#8212;if I may not remember
</p>
<p class="i2">
One who lives far away where the storm-cloud went;
</p>
<p>
May it part and starshine burn in many a quiet ember,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Over her towered city crowned with large content;
</p>
<p>
Dear God, let me sleep, here where deep peace is,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Let me own a dreamless sleep once for all the years,
</p>
<p>
Let me know a quiet mind and what heart ease is,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Lost to light and life and hope, to longing and to tears.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Here in the solitude less her memory presses,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Yet I see her lingering where the birches shine,
</p>
<p>
All the dark cedars are sleep-laden like her tresses,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The gold-moted wood-pools pellucid as her eyen;
</p>
<p>
Memories and ghost-forms of the days departed
</p>
<p class="i2">
People all the forest lone in the dead of night;
</p>
<p>
While Pot&#224;n and Silver Lightning sleep, the happy-hearted,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Troop they from their fastnesses upon my sight.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Once when the tide came straining from the Lido,
</p>
<p class="i2">
In a sea of flame our gondola flickered like a sword,
</p>
<p>
Venice lay abroad builded like beauty's credo,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Smouldering like a gorget on the breast of the Lord:
</p>
<p>
Did she mourn for fame foredoomed or passion shattered
</p>
<p class="i2">
That with a sudden impulse she gathered at my side?
</p>
<p>
But when I spoke the ancient fates were flattered,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Chill there crept between us the imperceptible tide.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Once I well remember in her twilight garden,
</p>
<p class="i2">
She pulled a half-blown rose, I thought it meant for me,
</p>
<p>
But poising in the act, and with half a sigh for pardon,
</p>
<p class="i2">
She hid it in her bosom where none may dare to see:
</p>
<p>
Had she a subtle meaning?&#8212;would to God I knew it,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Where'er I am I always feel the rose leaves nestling there,
</p>
<p>
If I might know her mind and the thought which then flashed through it,
</p>
<p class="i2">
My soul might look to heaven not commissioned to despair.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Though she denied at parting the gift that I besought her,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Just a bit of ribbon or a strand of her hair;
</p>
<p>
Though she would not keep the token that I brought her,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Proud she stood and calm and marvellously fair;
</p>
<p>
Yet I saw her spirit&#8212;truth cannot dissemble&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Saw her pure as gold, staunch and keen and brave,
</p>
<p>
For she knows my worth and her heart was all atremble,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Lest her will should weaken and make her heart a slave.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
If she could be here where all the world is eager
</p>
<p class="i2">
For dear love with the primal Eden sway,
</p>
<p>
Where the blood is fire and no pulse is thin or meagre,
</p>
<p class="i2">
All the heart of all the world beats one way!
</p>
<p>
There is the land of fraud and fame and fashion,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Joy is but a gaud and withers in an hour,
</p>
<p>
Here is the land of quintessential passion,
</p>
<p>
Where in a wild throb Spring wells up with power.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She would hear the partridge drumming in the distance,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Rolling out his mimic thunder in the sultry noons;
</p>
<p>
Hear beyond the silver reach in ringing wild persistence
</p>
<p class="i2">
Reel remote the ululating laughter of the loons;
</p>
<p>
See the shy moose fawn nestling by its mother,
</p>
<p class="i2">
In a cool marsh pool where the sedges meet;
</p>
<p>
Rest by a moss-mound where the twin-flowers smother
</p>
<p class="i2">
With a drowse of orient perfume drenched in light and heat:
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She would see the dawn rise behind the smoky mountain,
</p>
<p class="i2">
In a jet of colour curving up to break,
</p>
<p>
While like spray from the iridescent fountain,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Opal fires weave over all the oval of the lake:
</p>
<p>
She would see like fireflies the stars alight and spangle
</p>
<p class="i2">
All the heaven meadows thick with growing dusk,
</p>
<p>
Feel the gipsy airs that gather up and tangle
</p>
<p>
The woodsy odours in a maze of myrrh and musk:
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
There in the forest all the birds are nesting,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Tells the hermit thrush the song he cannot tell,
</p>
<p>
While the white-throat sparrow never resting,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Even in the deepest night rings his crystal bell:
</p>
<p>
O, she would love me then with a wild elation,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Then she must love me and leave her lonely state,
</p>
<p>
Give me love yet keep her soul's imperial reservation,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Large as her deep nature and fathomless as fate:
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then, if she would lie beside me in the even,
</p>
<p class="i2">
On my deep couch heaped of balsam fir,
</p>
<p>
Fragrant with sleep as nothing under heaven,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Let the past and future mingle in one blur;
</p>
<p>
While all the stars were watchful and thereunder
</p>
<p class="i2">
Earth breathed not but took their silent light,
</p>
<p>
All life withdrew and wrapt in a wild wonder
</p>
<p class="i2">
Peace fell tranquil on the odorous night:
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She would let me steal,&#8212;not consenting or denying&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
One strong arm beneath her dusky hair,
</p>
<p>
She would let me bare, not resisting or complying,
</p>
<p class="i2">
One sweet breast so sweet and firm and fair;
</p>
<p>
Then with the quick sob of passion's shy endeavour,
</p>
<p class="i2">
She would gather close and shudder and swoon away,
</p>
<p>
She would be mine for ever and for ever,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Mine for all time and beyond the judgment day.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Vain is the dream, and deep with all derision&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Fate is stern and hard&#8212;fair and false and vain&#8212;
</p>
<p>
But what would life be worth without the vision,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Dark with sordid passion, pale with wringing pain?
</p>
<p>
What I dream is mine, mine beyond all cavil,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Pure and fair and sweet, and mine for evermore,
</p>
<p>
And when I will my life I may unravel,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And find my passion dream deep at the red core.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Venus sinks first lost in ruby splendour,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Stars like wood-daffodils grow golden in the night,
</p>
<p>
Far, far above, in a space entranced and tender,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Floats the growing moon pale with virgin light.
</p>
<p>
Vaster than the world or life or death my trust is
</p>
<p class="i2">
Based in the unseen and towering far above;
</p>
<p>
Hold me, O Law, that deeper lies than Justice,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Guide me, O Light, that stronger burns than Love.

AN IMPROMPTU
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Here in the pungent gloom
</p>
<p>
Where the tamarac roses glow
</p>
<p>
And the balsam burns its perfume,
</p>
<p>
A vireo turns his slow
</p>
<p>
Cadence, as if he gloated
</p>
<p>
Over the last phrase he floated;
</p>
<p>
Each one he moulds and mellows
</p>
<p>
Matching it with its fellows:
</p>
<p>
So have you noted
</p>
<p>
How the oboe croons,
</p>
<p>
The canary-throated,
</p>
<p>
In the gloom of the violoncellos
</p>
<p>
And bassoons.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But afar in the thickset forest
</p>
<p>
I hear a sound go free,
</p>
<p>
Crashing the stately neighbours
</p>
<p>
The pine and the cedar tree,
</p>
<p>
Horns and harps and tabors,
</p>
<p>
Drumming and harping and horning
</p>
<p>
In savage minstrelsy&#8212;
</p>
<p>
It wakes in my soul a warning
</p>
<p>
Of the wind of destiny.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
My life is soaring and swinging
</p>
<p>
In triple walls of quiet,
</p>
<p>
In my heart there is rippling and ringing
</p>
<p>
A song with melodious riot,
</p>
<p>
When a fateful thing comes nigh it
</p>
<p>
A hush falls, and then
</p>
<p>
I hear in the thickset world
</p>
<p>
The wind of destiny hurled
</p>
<p>
On the lives of men.

THE HALF-BREED GIRL

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She is free of the trap and the paddle,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The portage and the trail,
</p>
<p>
But something behind her savage life
</p>
<p class="i2">
Shines like a fragile veil.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Her dreams are undiscovered,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Shadows trouble her breast,
</p>
<p>
When the time for resting cometh
</p>
<p class="i2">
Then least is she at rest.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Oft in the morns of winter,
</p>
<p class="i2">
When she visits the rabbit snares,
</p>
<p>
An appearance floats in the crystal air
</p>
<p class="i2">
Beyond the balsam firs.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Oft in the summer mornings
</p>
<p class="i2">
When she strips the nets of fish,
</p>
<p>
The smell of the dripping net-twine
</p>
<p class="i2">
Gives to her heart a wish.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But she cannot learn the meaning
</p>
<p class="i2">
Of the shadows in her soul,
</p>
<p>
The lights that break and gather,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The clouds that part and roll,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The reek of rock-built cities,

<p class="i2">
Where her fathers dwelt of yore,

The gleam of loch and shealing,

<p class="i2">
The mist on the moor,

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Frail traces of kindred kindness,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Of feud by hill and strand,
</p>
<p>
The heritage of an age-long life
</p>
<p class="i2">
In a legendary land.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She wakes in the stifling wigwam,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Where the air is heavy and wild,
</p>
<p>
She fears for something or nothing
</p>
<p class="i2">
With the heart of a frightened child.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She sees the stars turn slowly
</p>
<p class="i2">
Past the tangle of the poles,
</p>
<p>
Through the smoke of the dying embers,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Like the eyes of dead souls.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Her heart is shaken with longing
</p>
<p class="i2">
For the strange, still years,

For what she knows and knows not,

<p class="i2">
For the wells of ancient tears.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A voice calls from the rapids,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Deep, careless and free,

<p>
A voice that is larger than her life

<p class="i2">
Or than her death shall be.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
She covers her face with her blanket,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Her fierce soul hates her breath,

As it cries with a sudden passion

<p class="i2">
For life or death.

NIGHT BURIAL IN THE FOREST
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Lay him down where the fern is thick and fair.
</p>
<p>
Fain was he for life, here lies he low:
</p>
<p>
With the blood washed clean from his brow and his beautiful hair,
</p>
<p>
Lay him here in the dell where the orchids grow.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Let the birch-bark torches roar in the gloom,
</p>
<p>
And the trees crowd up in a quiet startled ring
</p>
<p>
So lone is the land that in this lonely room
</p>
<p>
Never before has breathed a human thing.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Cover him well in his canvas shroud, and the moss
</p>
<p>
Part and heap again on his quiet breast,
</p>
<p>
What recks he now of gain, or love, or loss
</p>
<p>
Who for love gained rest?
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
While she who caused it all hides her insolent eyes
</p>
<p>
Or braids her hair with the ribbons of lust and of lies,
</p>
<p>
And he who did the deed fares out like a hunted beast
</p>
<p>
To lurk where the musk-ox tramples the barren ground
</p>
<p>
Where the stroke of his coward heart is the only sound.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Haunting the tamarac shade,
</p>
<p>
Hear them up-thronging
</p>
<p>
Memories foredoomed
</p>
<p>
Of strife and of longing:
</p>
<p>
Haggard or bright
</p>
<p>
By the tamaracs and birches,
</p>
<p>
Where the red torch light
</p>
<p>
Trembles and searches,
</p>
<p>
The wilderness teems
</p>
<p>
With inscrutable eyes
</p>
<p>
Of ghosts that are dreams
</p>
<p>
Commingled with memories.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Leave him here in his secret ferny tomb,
</p>
<p>
Withdraw the little light from the ocean of gloom,
</p>
<p>
He who feared nought will fear aught never,
</p>
<p>
Left alone in the forest forever and ever.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then, as we fare on our way to the shore
</p>
<p>
Sudden the torches cease to roar:
</p>
<p>
For cleaving the darkness remote and still
</p>
<p>
Comes a wind with a rushing, harp-like thrill,
</p>
<p>
The sound of wings hurled and furled and unfurled,
</p>
<p>
The wings of the Angel who gathers the souls from the wastes of the world.

MEDITATION AT PERUGIA
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The sunset colours mingle in the sky,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And over all the Umbrian valleys flow;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Trevi is touched with wonder, and the glow
</p>
<p>
Finds high Perugia crimson with renown;
</p>
<p class="i4">
Spello is bright;
</p>
<p>
And, ah! St. Francis, thy deep-treasured town,
</p>
<p class="i4">
Enshrined Assisi, fully fronts the light.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
This valley knew thee many a year ago;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Thy shrine was built by simpleness of heart;
</p>
<p class="i2">
And from the wound called life thou drew'st the smart:
</p>
<p>
Unquiet kings came to thee and the sad poor&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i4">
Thou gavest them peace;
</p>
<p>
Far as the Sultan and the Iberian shore
</p>
<p class="i4">
Thy faith and abnegation gave release.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Deeper our faith, but not so sweet as thine;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Wider our view, but not so sanely sure;
</p>
<p class="i2">
For we are troubled by the witching lure
</p>
<p>
Of Science, with her lightning on the mist;
</p>
<p class="i4">
Science that clears,
</p>
<p>
Yet never quite discloses what she wist,
</p>
<p class="i4">
And leaves us half with doubts and half with fears.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
We act her dreams that shadow forth the truth,
</p>
<p class="i2">
That somehow here the very nerves of God
</p>
<p class="i2">
Thrill the old fires, the rocks, the primal sod;
</p>
<p>
We throw our speech upon the open air,
</p>
<p class="i4">
And it is caught
</p>
<p>
Far down the world, to sing and murmur there;
</p>
<p class="i4">
Our common words are with deep wonder fraught.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Shall not the subtle spirit of man contrive
</p>
<p class="i2">
To charm the tremulous ether of the soul,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Wherein it breathes?&#8212;until, from pole to pole,
</p>
<p>
Those who are kin shall speak, as face to face,
</p>
<p class="i4">
From star to star,
</p>
<p>
Even from earth to the most secret place,
</p>
<p class="i4">
Where God and the supreme archangels are.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Shall we not prove, what thou hast faintly taught,
</p>
<p class="i2">
That all the powers of earth and air are one,
</p>
<p class="i2">
That one deep law persists from mole to sun?
</p>
<p>
Shall we not search the heart of God and find
</p>
<p class="i4">
That law empearled,
</p>
<p>
Until all things that are in matter and mind
</p>
<p class="i4">
Throb with the secret that began the world?
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Yea, we have journeyed since thou trod'st the road,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Yet still we keep the foreappointed quest;

<p class="i2">
While the last sunset smoulders in the West,
</p>
<p>
Still the great faith with the undying hope
</p>
<p class="i4">
Upsprings and flows,
</p>
<p>
While dim Assisi fades on the wide slope
</p>
<p class="i4">
And the deep Umbrian valleys fill with rose.

THE WOOD-SPRING TO THE POET
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Dawn-cool, dew-cool
</p>
<p>
Gleams the surface of my pool
</p>
<p>
Bird haunted, fern enchanted,
</p>
<p>
Where but tempered spirits rule;
</p>
<p>
Stars do not trace their mystic lines
</p>
<p>
In my confines;
</p>
<p>
I take a double night within my breast
</p>
<p>
A night of darkened heavens, a night of leaves,
</p>
<p>
And in the two-fold dark I hear the owl
</p>
<p>
Puff at his velvet horn
</p>
<p>
And the wolves howl.
</p>
<p>
Even daylight comes with a touch of gold
</p>
<p>
Not overbold,
</p>
<p>
And shows dwarf-cornel and the twin-flowers,
</p>
<p>
Below the balsam bowers,
</p>
<p>
Their tints enamelled in my dew-drop shield.
</p>
<p>
Too small even for a thirsty fawn
</p>
<p>
To quench upon,
</p>
<p>
I hold my crystal at one level
</p>
<p>
There where you see the liquid bevel
</p>
<p>
Break in silver and go free
</p>
<p>
Singing to its destiny.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Give, Poet, give!
</p>
<p>
Thus only shalt thou live.
</p>
<p>
Give! for 'tis thy joyous doom
</p>
<p>
To charm, to comfort, to illume.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Speak to the maiden and the child
</p>
<p>
With accents deep and mild,
</p>
<p>
Tell them of the world so wide
</p>
<p>
In words of wonder and pure pride,
</p>
<p>
Touched with the rapture of surprise
</p>
<p>
That dwells in a child angel's eyes,
</p>
<p>
Awed with the strangeness of new-birth,
</p>
<p>
When the flaming seraph sent
</p>
<p>
To lead him into Paradise,
</p>
<p>
Calls his name with the mother's voice
</p>
<p>
He has just ceased to hear on earth.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Give to the youth his heart's content,

But power with prudence blent,

With courage his heart prove,
</p>
<p>
Till over his spirit shall roll
</p>
<p>
The vast wave of control.
</p>
<p>
In the cages and dens of strife,
</p>
<p>
Where men draw breath
</p>
<p>
Thick with a curse at the dear thing called life,
</p>
<p>
Give them courage to bear,
</p>
<p>
Strength to aspire and dare;
</p>
<p>
Give them hopes rooted in stone,
</p>
<p>
That the loveliest flowers take on,
</p>
<p>
Bind on their brows with a gesture free
</p>
<p>
The palm green bays of liberty.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Give to the mothers of men

<p>
The knowledge of joy in pain,

That grew in the breast of the Lord
</p>
<p>
On the dawn of the seventh morn;

For 'tis they who re-create the world

<p>
Whenever a child is born.

<p>
The soul with an alluring pleasure,

Prelusive to a deeper thrill,
</p>
<p>
A richer tone, a fuller measure;
</p>
<p>
Like voices, veiled with hidden treasure,
</p>
<p>
Of angels on a windy morning,
</p>
<p>
That first far off, then all together,
</p>
<p>
Come with a glorious clarion calling;
</p>
<p>
And when they swoon beneath the spell
</p>
<p>
Recapture them to hear the echoes
</p>
<p>
Falling&#8212;falling&#8212;falling.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
To those stoned for the truth

<p>
Give ruth;

<p>
Give manna for the mourner's mouth
</p>
<p>
Sovereign as air;
</p>
<p>
For his heart's drouth
</p>
<p>
A prayer.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Give to dead souls that mock at life
</p>
<p>
Aweary of their cankered hearts,

<p>
Weary of sleep and weary of strife,

<p>
Weary of markets and of arts,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Helve them a song of life,
</p>
<p>
Two-edged with joyous life,
</p>
<p>
Tempered trusty with life,

<p>
Proud pointed with wild life,

<p>
Plunge it as lightning plunges,
</p>
<p>
Stab them to life!

Give to those who grieve in secret,

Those who bear the sorrows of earth,

The deep unappeasable longings

Which beset them with throngings and throngings,
</p>
<p>
(As, on a windless night,
</p>
<p>
Through the fold of a dark mantle furled,
</p>
<p>
Gleams on our world, world after unknown world)
</p>
<p>
Give them peace,
</p>
<p>
Wide as the veil that hides God's face,
</p>
<p>
The pure plenitude of space,
</p>
<p>
In which our universe is but a glittering crease,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Give them such peace.

Thus only shalt thou live:

Give as we give who are hidden

In myriad dimples of rock and fern;

Give as we give unbidden

<p>
To tarn and rillet and burn,

<p>
Where the lake dreams,

Where the fall is hurled,

Striving to sweeten
</p>
<p>
The oceans of the world.

Silence fall in the woodland peace;

Say to my heart be still&#8212;be still,

Let the murmur die with the rill;

Then should the glittering, grey sea-things

Sigh as they wallow the under springs;

Where the deep brine-pools used to lie

Deserts vast would stare at the sky,

And even thy rich heart

(O Poet, Poet!)

Even thy rich heart run dry.

THE NOVEMBER PANSY
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
This is not June,&#8212;by Autumn's stratagem
</p>
<p>
Thou hast been ambushed in the chilly air;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Upon thy fragile crest virginal fair
</p>
<p>
The rime has clustered in a diadem;
</p>
<p class="i2">
The early frost
</p>
<p>
Has nipped thy roots and tried thy tender stem,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Seared thy gold petals, all thy charm is lost.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Thyself the only sunshine: in obeying
</p>
<p>
The law that bids thee blossom in the world
</p>
<p class="i2">
Thy little flag of courage is unfurled;
</p>
<p>
Inherent pansy-memories are saying
</p>
<p class="i2">
That there is sun,
</p>
<p>
That there is dew and colour and warmth repaying
</p>
<p class="i2">
The rain, the starlight when the light is done.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
These are the gaunt forms of the hollyhocks
</p>
<p>
That shower the seeds from out their withered purses;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Here were the pinks; there the nasturtium nurses
</p>
<p>
The last of colour in her gaudy smocks;
</p>
<p class="i2">
The ruins yonder
</p>
<p>
Show but a vestige of the flaming phlox;
</p>
<p class="i2">
The poppies on their faded glory ponder.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Here visited the vagrant humming-bird,
</p>
<p>
The nebulous darting green, the ruby-throated;
</p>
<p class="i2">
The warm fans of the butterfly here floated;
</p>
<p>
Those two nests reared the robins, and the third
</p>
<p class="i2">
Was left forlorn
</p>
<p>
Muffled in lilacs, whence the perfume stirred
</p>
<p class="i2">
The tremulous eyelids of the dewy morn.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Thy sisters of the early summer-time
</p>
<p>
Were masquers in this carnival of pleasure;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Each in her turn unrolled her golden treasure,
</p>
<p>
And thou hast but the ashes of the prime;
</p>
<p class="i2">
'Tis life's own malice
</p>
<p>
That brings the peasant of a race sublime
</p>
<p class="i2">
To feed her flock around her ruined palace.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Yet for withstanding thus the autumn's dart
</p>
<p>
Some deeper pansy-insight will atone;
</p>
<p class="i2">
It comes to souls neglected and alone,
</p>
<p>
Something that prodigals in pleasure's mart
</p>
<p class="i2">
Lose in the whirl;
</p>
<p>
The peasant child will have a purer heart
</p>
<p class="i2">
Than the vain favourite of the vanished earl.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And far above this tragic world of ours
</p>
<p>
There is a world of a diviner fashion,
</p>
<p class="i2">
A mystic world, a world of dreams and passion
</p>
<p>
That each aspiring thing creates and dowers
</p>
<p class="i2">
With its own light;
</p>
<p>
Where even the frail spirits of trees and flowers
</p>
<p class="i2">
Pause, and reach out, and pass from height to height.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Here will we claim for thee another fief,
</p>
<p>
An upland where a glamour haunts the meadows,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Snow peaks arise enrobed in rosy shadows,
</p>
<p>
Fairer the under slopes with vine and sheaf
</p>
<p class="i2">
And shimmering lea;
</p>
<p>
The paradise of a simple old belief,
</p>
<p class="i2">
That flourished in the Islands of the Sea.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A snow-cool cistern in the fairy hills
</p>
<p>
Shall feed thy roots with moisture clear as dew;
</p>
<p class="i2">
A ferny shield to temper the warm blue
</p>
<p>
That heaven is; a thrush that thrills
</p>
<p class="i2">
To answer his mate,

<p>
And when above the ferns the shadow fills,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Fireflies to render darkness consolate.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Here muse and brood, moulding thy seed and die

<p>
And re-create thy form a thousand fold,

Mellowing thy petals to more lucent gold,
</p>
<p>
Till they expand, tissues of amber sky;
</p>
<p class="i2">
Till the full hour,

<p>
And the full light and the fulfilling eye

THE HEIGHT OF LAND

<div class="stanza">
<p>
Here is the height of land:
</p>
<p>
The watershed on either hand
</p>
<p>
Goes down to Hudson Bay
</p>
<p>
Or Lake Superior;
</p>
<p>
The stars are up, and far away
</p>
<p>
The wind sounds in the wood, wearier
</p>
<p>
Than the long Ojibway cadence
</p>
<p>
In which Pot&#224;n the Wise
</p>
<p>
Declares the ills of life
</p>
<p>
And Chees-que-ne-ne makes a mournful sound
</p>
<p>
Of acquiescence. The fires burn low
</p>
<p>
With just sufficient glow
</p>
<p>
To light the flakes of ash that play
</p>
<p>
At being moths, and flutter away
</p>
<p>
To fall in the dark and die as ashes:
</p>
<p>
Here there is peace in the lofty air,
</p>
<p>
And Something comes by flashes
</p>
<p>
Deeper than peace;&#8212;
</p>
<p>
The spruces have retired a little space
</p>
<p>
And left a field of sky in violet shadow
</p>
<p>
With stars like marigolds in a water-meadow.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Now the Indian guides are dead asleep;
</p>
<p>
There is no sound unless the soul can hear
</p>
<p>
The gathering of the waters in their sources.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
We have come up through the spreading lakes
</p>
<p>
From level to level,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Pitching our tents sometimes over a revel
</p>
<p>
Of roses that nodded all night,
</p>
<p>
Dreaming within our dreams,
</p>
<p>
To wake at dawn and find that they were captured
</p>
<p>
With no dew on their leaves;
</p>
<p>
Sometimes mid sheaves
</p>
<p>
Of braken and dwarf-cornel, and again
</p>
<p>
On a wide blue-berry plain
</p>
<p>
Brushed with the shimmer of a bluebird's wing;
</p>
<p>
A rocky islet followed
</p>
<p>
With one lone poplar and a single nest
</p>
<p>
Of white-throat-sparrows that took no rest
</p>
<p>
But sang in dreams or woke to sing,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
To the last portage and the height of land&#8212;:
</p>
<p>
Upon one hand
</p>
<p>
The lonely north enlaced with lakes and streams,
</p>
<p>
And the enormous targe of Hudson Bay,
</p>
<p>
Glimmering all night
</p>
<p>
In the cold arctic light;
</p>
<p>
On the other hand
</p>
<p>
The crowded southern land
</p>
<p>
With all the welter of the lives of men.
</p>
<p>
But here is peace, and again
</p>
<p>
That Something comes by flashes
</p>
<p>
Deeper than peace,&#8212;a spell
</p>
<p>
Golden and inappellable
</p>
<p>
That gives the inarticulate part
</p>
<p>
Of our strange being one moment of release
</p>
<p>
That seems more native than the touch of time,
</p>
<p>
And we must answer in chime;
</p>
<p>
Though yet no man may tell
</p>
<p>
The secret of that spell
</p>
<p>
Golden and inappellable.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Now are there sounds walking in the wood,
</p>
<p>
And all the spruces shiver and tremble,
</p>
<p>
And the stars move a little in their courses.
</p>
<p>
The ancient disturber of solitude
</p>
<p>
Breathes a pervasive sigh,
</p>
<p>
And the soul seems to hear
</p>
<p>
The gathering of the waters at their sources;
</p>
<p>
Then quiet ensues and pure starlight and dark;
</p>
<p>
The region-spirit murmurs in meditation,
</p>
<p>
The heart replies in exaltation
</p>
<p>
And echoes faintly like an inland shell
</p>
<p>
Ghost tremors of the spell;
</p>
<p>
Thought reawakens and is linked again
</p>
<p>
With all the welter of the lives of men.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Here on the uplands where the air is clear
</p>
<p>
We think of life as of a stormy scene,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Of tempest, of revolt and desperate shock;
</p>
<p>
And here, where we can think, on the bright uplands
</p>
<p>
Where the air is clear, we deeply brood on life
</p>
<p>
Until the tempest parts, and it appears
</p>
<p>
As simple as to the shepherd seems his flock:
</p>
<p>
A Something to be guided by ideals&#8212;
</p>
<p>
That in themselves are simple and serene&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Of noble deed to foster noble thought,
</p>
<p>
And noble thought to image noble deed,
</p>
<p>
Till deed and thought shall interpenetrate,
</p>
<p>
Making life lovelier, till we come to doubt
</p>
<p>
Whether the perfect beauty that escapes
</p>
<p>
Is beauty of deed or thought or some high thing
</p>
<p>
Mingled of both, a greater boon than either:
</p>
<p>
Thus we have seen in the retreating tempest
</p>
<p>
The victor-sunlight merge with the ruined rain,
</p>
<p>
And from the rain and sunlight spring the rainbow.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The ancient disturber of solitude
</p>
<p>
Stirs his ancestral potion in the gloom,
</p>
<p>
And the dark wood
</p>
<p>
Is stifled with the pungent fume
</p>
<p>
Of charred earth burnt to the bone
</p>
<p>
That takes the place of air.
</p>
<p>
Then sudden I remember when and where,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
The last weird lakelet foul with weedy growths
</p>
<p>
And slimy viscid things the spirit loathes,
</p>
<p>
Skin of vile water over viler mud
</p>
<p>
Where the paddle stirred unutterable stenches,
</p>
<p>
And the canoes seemed heavy with fear,
</p>
<p>
Not to be urged toward the fatal shore
</p>
<p>
Where a bush fire, smouldering, with sudden roar
</p>
<p>
Leaped on a cedar and smothered it with light
</p>
<p>
And terror. It had left the portage-height
</p>
<p>
A tangle of slanted spruces burned to the roots,
</p>
<p>
Covered still with patches of bright fire
</p>
<p>
Smoking with incense of the fragrant resin
</p>
<p>
That even then began to thin and lessen
</p>
<p>
Into the gloom and glimmer of ruin.

<div class="stanza">

</p>
<p class="i2">
They shall be after the race of men

How often in the autumn of the world

Shall the crystal shrine of dawning be rebuilt

<p>
With deeper meaning! Shall the poet then,

Brood on the welter of the lives of men
</p>
<p>
And dream of his ideal hope and promise
</p>
<p>
In the blush sunrise? Shall he base his flight
</p>
<p>
Upon a more compelling law than Love
</p>
<p>
As Life's atonement; shall the vision
</p>
<p>
Of noble deed and noble thought immingled
</p>
<p>
Seem as uncouth to him as the pictograph
</p>
<p>
Scratched on the cave side by the cave-dweller
</p>
<p>
To us of the Christ-time? Shall he stand
</p>
<p>
With deeper joy, with more complex emotion,
</p>
<p>
In closer commune with divinity,
</p>
<p>
With the deep fathomed, with the firmament charted,
</p>
<p>
With life as simple as a sheep-boy's song,
</p>
<p>
What lies beyond a romaunt that was read
</p>
<p>
Once on a morn of storm and laid aside
</p>
<p>
Memorious with strange immortal memories?
</p>
<p>
Or shall he see the sunrise as I see it
</p>
<p>
In shoals of misty fire the deluge-light
</p>
<p>
Dashes upon and whelms with purer radiance,
</p>
<p>
And feel the lulled earth, older in pulse and motion,
</p>
<p>
Turn the rich lands and the inundant oceans
</p>
<p>
To the flushed color, and hear as now I hear
</p>
<p>
The thrill of life beat up the planet's margin
</p>
<p>
And break in the clear susurrus of deep joy
</p>
<p>
That echoes and re&#235;choes in my being?
</p>
<p>
O Life is intuition the measure of knowledge
</p>
<p>
And do I stand with heart entranced and burning
</p>
<p>
At the zenith of our wisdom when I feel
</p>
<p>
The long light flow, the long wind pause, the deep
</p>
<p>
Influx of spirit, of which no man may tell
</p>
<p>
The Secret, golden and inappellable?

NEW YEAR'S NIGHT, 1916

<p>
The Earth moans in her sleep
</p>
<p>
Like an old mother
</p>
<p>
Whose sons have gone to the war,
</p>
<p>
Who weeps silently in her heart
</p>
<p>
Till dreams comfort her.
</p>

The Earth tosses

As if she would shake off humanity,

A burden too heavy to be borne,

And free of the pest of intolerable men,
</p>
<p>
Spin with woods and waters
</p>
<p>
Joyously in the clear heavens
</p>
<p>
In the beautiful cool rains,
</p>
<p>
Bearing gladly the dumb animals,
</p>
<p>
And sleep when the time comes
</p>
<p>
Glistening in the remains of sunlight
</p>
<p>
With marmoreal innocency.

Be comforted, old mother,

Of your burden of passionate men,
</p>

For without them who would dream the dreams

<p>
That encompass you with glory,

<p>
Who would gather your youth

<p>
And store it in the jar of remembrance,

<p>
Who would comfort your old heart

<p>
With tales told of the heroes,

<p>
Who would cover your face with the cerecloth

All rustling with stars,

<p>
And mourn in the ashes of sunlight,

<p>
Mourn your marmoreal innocency?

FRAGMENT OF AN ODE TO CANADA

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i16">
This is the land!
</p>
<p>
It lies outstretched a vision of delight,
</p>
<p>
Bent like a shield between the silver seas
</p>
<p>
It flashes back the hauteur of the sun;
</p>
<p>
Yet teems with humblest beauties, still a part
</p>
<p>
Of its Titanic and ebullient heart.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Land of the glacial, lonely mountain ranges,
</p>
<p>
Where nothing haps save vast &#198;onian changes,
</p>
<p>
The slow moraine, the avalanche's wings,
</p>
<p>
Summer and Sun,&#8212;the elemental things,
</p>
<p>
Pulses of Awe,&#8212;Winter and Night and the lightnings.
</p>
<p>
Land of the pines that rear their dusky spars
</p>
<p>
A ready midnight for the earliest stars.
</p>
<p>
The land of rivers, rivulets, and rills,
</p>
<p>
Straining incessant everyway to the sea
</p>
<p>
With their white thunder harnessed in the mills,
</p>
<p>
Turning one wealth to another wealth perpetually;
</p>
<p>
Spinning the lightning with dynamic spindles,
</p>
<p>
Till some far city dowered with fire enkindles.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The land of fruit, fine-flavoured with the frost,
</p>
<p>
Land of the cattle, the deep-chested host,
</p>
<p>
The happy-souled, that contemplate the hours,
</p>
<p>
Their dew-laps buried in the grass and flowers.
</p>
<p>
And, O! the myriad-miracle of the grain
</p>
<p>
Cresting the hill, brimming the level plain,
</p>
<p>
The miracle of the flower and milk and kernel,
</p>
<p>
Nurtured by sun-fire and frost-fire supernal,
</p>
<p>
Until the farmer turns it in his hand,
</p>
<p>
The million-millioned miracle of the land.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And yet with all these pastoral and heroic graces,
</p>
<p>
Our simplest flowers wear the loveliest faces;
</p>
<p>
The sparrows are our most enraptured singers,
</p>
<p>
And round their songs the fondest memory lingers;
</p>
<p>
Our forests tower and tremble, star-enchanted,
</p>
<p>
Their roots are by the timid spirits haunted
</p>
<p>
Of hermit thrushes,&#8212;tranc&#232;d is the air,
</p>
<p>
Ever in doubt when they shall sing or where;
</p>
<p>
The mountains may with ice and avalanche wrestle,
</p>
<p>
Far down their rugged steeps dimple and nestle
</p>
<p>
The still, translucent, turquoise-hearted tarns.

And Thou, O Power, that 'stablishest the Nation,

<p>
Give wisdom in the midst of our elation;

<p>
Who are so free that we forget we are&#8212;
</p>
<p>
That freedom brings the deepest obligation:
</p>
<p>
Grant us this presage for a guiding star,
</p>
<p>
To lead the van of Peace, not with a craven spirit,
</p>
<p>
But with the consciousness that we inherit
</p>
<p>
What built the Empire out of blood and fire,
</p>
<p>
And can smite, too, in passion and with ire.
</p>
<p>
Purge us of Pride, who are so quick in vaunting
</p>
<p>
Thy gift, this land, that is in nothing wanting;
</p>
<p>
Give Mind to match the glory of the gift,
</p>
<p>
Give great Ideals to bridge the sordid rift
</p>
<p>
Between our heritage and our use of it.

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Then in some day of terror for the world,
</p>
<p>
When all the flags of the Furies are unfurled,
</p>
<p>
When Truth and Justice, wildered and unknit,
</p>
<p>
Shall turn for help to this young, radiant land,
</p>
<p>
We shall be quick to see and understand:
</p>
<p>
What shall we answer in that stricken hour?
</p>
<p>
Shall the deep thought be pregnant then with power?
</p>
<p>
Shall the few words spring swift and grave and clear?
</p>
<p>
Use well the present moment. They shall hear.

Here in Samarcand they offer emeralds,

<p>
Pure as frozen drops of sea-water,
</p>
<p>
Rubies, pale as dew-ponds stained with slaughter,
</p>
<p>
Where the fairies fought for a king's daughter
</p>
<p>
In the elfin upland.
</p>
<p>
Here they sell you jade and calcedony,
</p>
<p>
And the matrix of the turquoise,
</p>
<p>
Spheres of onyx held in eagles' claws,
</p>
<p>
But they keep the gems as far asunder
</p>
<p>
From the dull stones as the lightning from the thunder;
</p>
<p>
They can never come together
</p>
<p>
On the mats of Turkish leather
</p>

In the booths of Samarcand.

<p>
Here they sell you balls of nard and honey,
</p>
<p>
And squat jars of clarid butter,
</p>
<p>
And the cheese from Kurdistan.
</p>
<p>
When you offer Frankish money,
</p>
<p>
Then they scowl and curse and mutter,
</p>
<p>
Deep in Kurdish or Persan
</p>
<p>
For they want your heart out and my hand
</p>
<p>
In the booths of Samarcand.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
They would sell your heart's blood separate,
</p>
<p>
In a jar with a gold brim,
</p>
<p>
With a text of burning hatred
</p>
<p>
Coiled around the rim;
</p>
<p>
They would sell my hand upon a beam of teak wood,
</p>
<p>
In the other scale a feather curled;
</p>
<p>
They would sell your heart upon a silver balance
</p>
<p>
Weighed against the world.
</p>
<p>
But your heart could never touch my hand,
</p>
<p>
They could never come together

On the mats of Turkish leather

MADONNA WITH TWO ANGELS

Over the blackberry fences floats.

Madonna sits in a cedar chair

One of the angels asleep on her knee

Under the shade of an apple tree.

THE BEGGAR AND THE ANGEL
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
An angel burdened with self-pity
</p>
<p>
Came out of heaven to a modern city.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He saw a beggar on the street,
</p>
<p>
Where the tides of traffic meet.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A pair of brass-bound hickory pegs
</p>
<p>
Brought him his pence instead of legs.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
A murky dog by him did lie,
</p>
<p>
Poodle, in part, his ancestry.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The angel stood and thought upon
</p>
<p>
This poodle-haunted beggar man.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;My life is grown a bore,&#34; said he,
</p>
<p>
&#34;One long round of sciamachy;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I think I'll do a little good,
</p>
<p>
By way of change from angelhood.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He drew near to the beggar grim,
</p>
<p>
And gravely thus accosted him:
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;How would you like, my friend, to fly
</p>
<p>
All day through the translucent sky;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
To knock at the door of the red leaven,
</p>
<p>
And even to enter the orthodox heaven?
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
If you would care to know this joy,
</p>
<p>
I will surrender my employ,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And take your ills, collect your pelf,
</p>
<p>
An humble beggar like yourself.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
For ages you these joys may know,
</p>
<p>
While I shall suffer here below;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And in the end we both may gain
</p>
<p>
Access of pleasure from my pain.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The stationary vagrant said,
</p>
<p>
&#34;I do not mind, so go ahead.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The angel told the heavenly charm,
</p>
<p>
He felt a wing on either arm;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Good-day,&#34; he said, &#34;this floating's queer
</p>
<p>
If I should want to change next year&#8212;?&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Pull out that feather!&#34; the angel said,
</p>
<p>
&#34;The one half black and the other half red.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The cripple cried, &#34;Before you're through
</p>
<p>
You may get fagged, and if you do,&#8212;&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The angel superciliously&#8212;
</p>
<p>
&#34;My transformed friend, don't think of me.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I shall be happy day and night,
</p>
<p>
In doing what I think is right.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;So so,&#34; the feathered beggar said,
</p>
<p>
&#34;Good-bye, I am just overhead.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<hr class="div">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The angel when he grasped the dish,
</p>
<p>
Began to criticize his wish.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The seat was hard as granite rocks,
</p>
<p>
His real legs were in the box.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
His knees were cramped, his shins were sore,
</p>
<p>
The lying pegs stuck out before.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
In vain he clinked the dish and whined.
</p>
<p>
The passers-by seemed deaf and blind.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
As pious looking as Saint Denis,
</p>
<p>
An urchin stole his catch-penny.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And even the beggar's drab-fleeced poodle
</p>
<p>
Began to know him for a noodle.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;It has an uncelestial scent,
</p>
<p>
The clothing of this mendicant;&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He cried, &#34;That trickling down my spine
</p>
<p>
Is anything but hyaline.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
This day is like a thousand years:
</p>
<p>
I'd give an age of sighs and tears
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
To see with his confectioned grin
</p>
<p>
One cherub sitting on his chin.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
That cripple was by far too sly&#8212;
</p>
<p>
I wish he'd tumble from the sky,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
That things might be as they were before;
</p>
<p>
I really cannot stand much more!&#34;
</p>
</div>
<hr class="div">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The beggar in the angel's guise,
</p>
<p>
Rose far above the smoky skies.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But being a beggar, never saw
</p>
<p>
The charm of the compelling law
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
That turned the swinging universe:
</p>
<p>
'Twas gloomy as an empty purse.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Often with heaven in his head,
</p>
<p>
He blundered on a planet dead.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And when with an immortal fuss,
</p>
<p>
He singed his wings at Sirius.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He plucked the feather with his teeth,
</p>
<p>
The charm was potent and beneath,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He saw the turmoil of the way
</p>
<p>
Grown wilder at the close of day,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
With the sad poodle, can in hand,
</p>
<p>
The angel still at the old stand.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;My friend,&#34; said the angel, hemming and humming,
</p>
<p>
&#34;Truly I thought you were never coming.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;That's an unhandsome thing to say,
</p>
<p>
Seeing I've only been gone a day.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But there's nothing in all your brazen sky
</p>
<p>
To match the cock of that poodle's eye.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Take your dish and give me my wings,
</p>
<p>
'Tis but a fair exchange of things.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<hr class="div">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The beggar felt his garment's rot,
</p>
<p>
The horn ridge of each callous spot;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He clinked his can and was content;
</p>
<p>
His poverty was permanent.

I gave her a rose in early June,

Over my heavy heart.

Upon the shore of sleep;

And parted from the earthly noise,

<p>
Leaving her world of toys,

To dwell a little in a dell of dream.

These fairy kisses,

A dearth of blisses,

A famine of delights,

If I had never had what now I value most;

Till all I have seems something I have lost;

A desert underneath the garden shows,

Till all my spirit's sphere,

Grows one half brightness and the other dead,

<p>
One half all joy, the other vague alarms;

<p>
And, holding each the other half in fee,
</p>
<p>
Floats like the growing moon

That bears implicitly

Her lessening pearl of shadow
</p>
<p>
Clasped in the crescent silver of her arms.

ELIZABETH SPEAKS
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
(Aetat Six)
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Now every night we light the grate
</p>
<p>
And I sit up till
<i>
really
</i>
late;
</p>
<p>
My Father sits upon the right,
</p>
<p>
My Mother on the left, and I
</p>
<p>
Between them on an ancient chair,
</p>
<p>
That once belonged to my Great-Gran,
</p>
<p>
Before my Father was a man.
</p>
<p>
We sit without another light;
</p>
<p>
I really, truly never tire
</p>
<p>
Watching that space, as black as night,
</p>
<p>
That hangs behind the fire;
</p>
<p>
For there sometimes, you know,
</p>
<p>
The dearest, queerest little sparks,
</p>
<p>
Without a sound creep to and fro;
</p>
<p>
Sometimes they form in rings
</p>
<p>
Or lines that look like many things,
</p>
<p>
Like skipping ropes, or hoops, or swings:
</p>
<p>
Before you know what you're about,
</p>
<p>
They all go out!
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
My Father says that they are gnomes,
</p>
<p>
Beyond the grate they have their homes,
</p>
<p>
In a tall, black, and windy town,
</p>
<p>
Behind a door we cannot see.
</p>
<p>
Often when it's time for bed
</p>
<p>
The children run away instead,
</p>
<p>
Out through the door to see our fire,
</p>
<p>
Then their angry parents come
</p>
<p>
With every candle in the town,
</p>
<p>
The beadle with his lantern too,
</p>
<p>
And search and rummage up and down,
</p>
<p>
To catch the children as they play,
</p>
<p>
Between the rows of new-mown hay,
</p>
<p>
And bring them home;
</p>
<p>
(They must be, O, so very small,
</p>
<p>
How do they capture them at all?
</p>
<p>
But then they must be very
<i>
dear</i>);
</p>
<p>
When they can find no more
</p>
<p>
They blow a horn we cannot hear,
</p>
<p>
And march with the beadle at their head,
</p>
<p>
Right through the little open door,
</p>
<p>
Then close it tight and go to bed.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
My Mother says that may be so;
</p>
<p>
(They both agree they're
<i>
gnomes</i>, you know).
</p>
<p>
She says, she thinks that every night,
</p>
<p>
The gnomes have had a fearful fight;
</p>
<p>
Their valiant General has been slain,
</p>
<p>
And all the soldiers leave the camp
</p>
<p>
To dig his grave upon the plain;
</p>
<p>
They drag the General on a gun;
</p>
<p>
Every bandsman has a lamp
</p>
<p>
And there's a torch for every one,
</p>
<p>
They dig his grave with bayonets
</p>
<p>
And wrap him grandly in his flag,
</p>
<p>
Then they gather in a ring,
</p>
<p>
The band plays very soft and low,
</p>
<p>
And all the soldiers sing.
</p>
<p>
(Of course we cannot hear, you know,)
</p>
<p>
Then some one calls &#34;The enemy comes!&#34;
</p>
<p>
They muffle up their pipes and drums;
</p>
<p>
Every soldier in a fright
</p>
<p>
Puts out his light.
</p>
<p>
Then hand in hand, and very still,
</p>
<p>
They clamber up the dark, dark hill
</p>
<p>
And hold their breath tight&#8212;tight.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
(I'd like to know which tale is right.)
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
O! there is something I forgot!
</p>
<p>
Sometimes one little spark burns on
</p>
<p>
Long after the rest have gone.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
My Father says that lamp is left
</p>
<p>
By a little crooked, crotchety man,
</p>
<p>
Who cannot find his wayward son;
</p>
<p>
When the horn begins to blow,
</p>
<p>
He has to drop his light and run.
</p>
<p>
Of course he limps so slow
</p>
<p>
He squeezes through the very last,
</p>
<p>
When he is gone the naughty scamp
</p>
<p>
Jumps up and puff! out goes the lamp.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
My Mother says that is the light,
</p>
<p>
Borne by the very bravest knight;
</p>
<p>
He is so very, very brave,
</p>
<p>
He would not leave his General's grave,
</p>
<p>
And when the Enemy General tries
</p>
<p>
To make him tell where his General lies,
</p>
<p>
He answers boldly, &#34;I&#8212;will&#8212;not!&#34;
</p>
<p>
Then they shoot him on the spot,
</p>
<p>
And give a horrid, dreadful shout,
</p>
<p>
And then of course his light goes out.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I sit and think when they are through,
</p>
<p>
Which tale I like best of the two.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I like the
<i>
Father
</i>
one;
</p>
<p>
It is such fun!
</p>
<p>
But then I love the
<i>
Mother
</i>
one,
</p>
<p>
That dear brave soldier and the rest:&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
<i>
Now which one do you like the best?</i>

A LEGEND OF CHRIST'S NATIVITY
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
At Bethlehem upon the hill,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The day was done, the night was nigh,
</p>
<p>
The dusk was deep and had its will,
</p>
<p>
The stars were very small and still,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Like unblown tapers, faint and high.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The noises had begun to fall,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And quiet stole upon the place,
</p>
<p>
The howl of dogs along the wall,
</p>
<p>
Voices that from the houstops call
</p>
<p class="i2">
And answer, and the grace
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Of some low breath of even-song
</p>
<p class="i2">
Grew faint apace: between the rocks
</p>
<p>
In misty pastures, and along
</p>
<p>
The dim hillside with crook and thong
</p>
<p class="i2">
The lonely shepherds watched their flocks.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The Inn-master within the Inn
</p>
<p class="i2">
Called loudly out after this sort,
</p>
<p>
&#34;Draw no more water, cease the din,
</p>
<p>
Pile the loose fodder, and begin
</p>
<p class="i2">
To turn the mules out of the court.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The time has come to shut the gate,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Make way,&#34; he cried, and then began
</p>
<p>
To sweep and set the litter straight,
</p>
<p>
And pile the saddle-bags and freight
</p>
<p class="i2">
Of some belated caravan.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The drivers whirled their beasts about,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And beat them on with shoutings great;
</p>
<p>
The nosebags slipped, the feed flew out,
</p>
<p>
The water-buckets reeled, the rout
</p>
<p class="i2">
Went jostling onward to the gate.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Came one unto the master then,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Hasting to find him through the gloom,
</p>
<p>
&#34;Give us a place to rest;&#34; and when
</p>
<p>
He spake, the master cried again,
</p>
<p class="i2">
&#34;There is no room&#8212;there is no room.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;But I have come from Nazareth,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Full three days' toil to Bethlehem&#34;&#8212;
</p>
<p>
&#34;What matters that,&#34; the master saith,
</p>
<p>
&#34;For here is hardly room for breath;
</p>
<p class="i2">
The guests curse me for crowding them.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Hold, Sir! leave me not so, I pray&#34;&#8212;
</p>
<p class="i2">
He plucked him sudden by the sleeve,
</p>
<p>
&#34;My wife is with me and doth say,
</p>
<p>
Her hour hath come, I beg you, stay,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And make some plan for her relief.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;Two hours ago you might have had
</p>
<p class="i2">
The chamber wherein stands the loom;
</p>
<p>
But then to drive me wholly mad,
</p>
<p>
Came this great merchant from Baghdad,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And thrust himself into the room.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;There is no other shelf to call
</p>
<p class="i2">
A bed&#8212;But just beyond the gate,
</p>
<p>
You may find shelter in a stall,
</p>
<p>
If there be shelter left at all,
</p>
<p class="i2">
You may be even now too late.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Beyond the gate within the night,
</p>
<p class="i2">
A figure rested on the ground,
</p>
<p>
About her all the rout took flight,
</p>
<p>
The dizzy noise, the flashing light,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The mules were tramping all around.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Leaning in mute expectancy,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Beneath a stunted sycamore,
</p>
<p>
She added darkness utterly,
</p>
<p>
To the dim light, the shrouded tree,
</p>
<p class="i2">
By her hands held her face before.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And yet to mock her eye's desire,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The cavern into which she stared,
</p>
<p>
Was lit with disks and lines of fire;
</p>
<p>
When triple darkness did conspire,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The secret founts of light were bared.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And all the wheeling fire was rife
</p>
<p class="i2">
With haunting fears, her broken breath
</p>
<p>
Grew short with this prophetic strife;
</p>
<p>
What was for one the dawn of life,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Would be for one the dawn of death.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Meantime the stranger with a lamp,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Which lit the darkness, small and wan,
</p>
<p>
Searched where the mules did tramp and stamp,
</p>
<p>
Amid the litter and the damp,
</p>
<p class="i2">
For some small place to rest upon.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And there against the furthest wall,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Where the black shade was dense and deep,
</p>
<p>
He found a mean and meager stall,
</p>
<p>
But there when the weak light did fall,
</p>
<p class="i2">
He found a little lad asleep.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
He lifted up his childish head,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And smiled serenely at the light,
</p>
<p>
&#34;And have you found him, then,&#34; he said,
</p>
<p>
&#34;My brother who I thought was dead,
</p>
<p class="i2">
I lost him in the crowd last night.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;His name is Ezra, and he is
</p>
<p class="i2">
So tall and strong that when I try,
</p>
<p>
Standing on tiptoe for a kiss
</p>
<p>
I could not reach, except for this,
</p>
<p class="i2">
He lifts me up so easily.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;I had two little doves to take
</p>
<p class="i2">
Up to the booths&#34;&#8212;he held his breath,
</p>
<p>
&#34;Peace, child! and for your mother's sake,
</p>
<p>
Yield me this place&#8212;nay, nay! awake!
</p>
<p class="i2">
My weary wife is sick to death.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;I will,&#34; the little lad replied
</p>
<p class="i2">
&#34;I promised never to forget
</p>
<p>
My mother, years ago she died,
</p>
<p>
I will lie out on the hillside,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And I may find dear Ezra yet.&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And now she drooped her weary head,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Within that comfortless manger,
</p>
<p>
It might have been a palace bed,
</p>
<p>
With canopy of gold instead,
</p>
<p class="i2">
So little did she know or care.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">

Gentle Jesus, slumber mild,</i>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
And out upon the darkened hill,
</p>
<p class="i2">
With all the quiet-pastured sheep,
</p>
<p>
Charmed by the falling of a rill,
</p>
<p>
Where in the pool it cadenced still,
</p>
<p class="i2">
The little lad was fallen asleep.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
All his young dreams were robed with power.
</p>
<p class="i2">
And glad were all his vision folk;
</p>
<p>
He wandered on from hour to hour,
</p>
<p>
With Ezra, happy as a flower
</p>
<p class="i2">
That blooms safe-shadowed by the oak.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
But once before his dreams were told,
</p>
<p class="i2">
He thought he saw within the deep
</p>
<p>
Vault of the sky a rose unfold,
</p>
<p>
Made all of fire and lovely gold,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Whose petals seemed to glow and leap,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
As if each dewy, crystal cell
</p>
<p class="i2">
Were a great angel live with light,
</p>
<p>
And trembling to the coronal,

<p>
Merging in sheen of pearl and shell,
</p>
<p class="i2">
With his great comrade, equal, bright,
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Until the petals flashed and sprang,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And folded to the central heart:
</p>
<p>
Music there was that showered and rang,

<p>
As if each angel harped and sang,
</p>
<p class="i2">
Controlled by some celestial art.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The child saw splendor without name,
</p>
<p class="i2">
And turned and smiled, and all the noise
</p>
<p>
Of strings and singing sank; it came
</p>
<p>
Faint and dream-altered, yet the same,

<p class="i2">
Soft-tempered to his mother's voice.

So in the shadow by the nimble flood

He made her whistles of the willow wood,

Flutes of one note with mellow slender tone;

<p>
(A robin piping in the dusk alone).

Lively the pleasure was the wand to bruise,

And notch the light rod for its lyric use,

And when the ground was covered with light chips,

Grey leaves and green, and twigs and tender slips,

THE LEAF

<p>
This silver-edged geranium leaf

<p>
Is one sign of a bitter grief
</p>
<p>
Whose symbols are a myriad more;
</p>
<p>
They cluster round a carven stone

Where she who sleeps is never alone

For two hearts at the core,

Vigil above the triune sleep,&#8212;

Edged all with silver are the leaves.

LINES IN MEMORY OF EDMUND MORRIS
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Dear Morris&#8212;here is your letter&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Can my answer reach you now?
</p>
<p>
Fate has left me your debtor,
</p>
<p>
You will remember how;
</p>
<p>
For I went away to Nantucket,
</p>
<p>
And you to the Isle of Orleans,
</p>
<p>
And when I was dawdling and dreaming
</p>
<p>
Over the ways and means
</p>
<p>
Of answering, the power was denied me,
</p>
<p>
Fate frowned and took her stand;
</p>
<p>
I have your unanswered letter
</p>
<p>
Here in my hand.
</p>
<p>
This&#8212;in your famous scribble,
</p>
<p>
It was ever a cryptic fist,
</p>
<p>
Cuneiform or Chaldaic
</p>
<p>
Meanings held in a mist.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Dear Morris, (now I'm inditing
</p>
<p>
And poring over your script)
</p>
<p>
I gather from the writing,
</p>
<p>
The coin that you had flipt,
</p>
<p>
Turned tails; and so you compel me
</p>
<p>
To meet you at Touchwood Hills:
</p>
<p>
Or, mayhap, you are trying to tell me
</p>
<p>
The sum of a painter's ills:
</p>
<p>
Is that Phimister Proctor
</p>
<p>
Or something about a doctor?
</p>
<p>
Well, nobody knows, but Eddie,
</p>
<p>
Whatever it is I'm ready.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
For our friendship was always fortunate
</p>
<p>
In its greetings and adieux,
</p>
<p>
Nothing flat or importunate,
</p>
<p>
Nothing of the misuse
</p>
<p>
That comes of the constant grinding
</p>
<p>
Of one mind on another.
</p>
<p>
So memory has nothing to smother,
</p>
<p>
But only a few things captured
</p>
<p>
On the wing, as it were, and enraptured.
</p>
<p>
Yes, Morris, I am inditing&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Answering at last it seems,
</p>
<p>
How can you read the writing
</p>
<p>
In the vacancy of dreams?
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I would have you look over my shoulder
</p>
<p>
Ere the long, dark year is colder,
</p>
<p>
And mark that as memory grows older,
</p>
<p>
The brighter it pulses and gleams.
</p>
<p>
And if I should try to render
</p>
<p>
The tissues of fugitive splendour
</p>
<p>
That fled down the wind of living,
</p>
<p>
Will they read it some day in the future,
</p>
<p>
And be conscious of an awareness
</p>
<p>
In our old lives, and the bareness
</p>
<p>
Of theirs, with the newest passions
</p>
<p>
In the last fad of the fashions?

How often have we risen without daylight

<p>
When the day star was hidden in mist,
</p>
<p>
When the dragon-fly was heavy with dew and sleep,
</p>
<p>
And viewed the miracle pre-eminent, matchless,
</p>
<p>
The prelusive light that quickens the morning.
</p>
<p>
O crystal dawn, how shall we distill your virginal freshness
</p>
<p>
When you steal upon a land that man has not sullied with his intrusion,
</p>
<p>
When the aboriginal shy dwellers in the broad solitudes
</p>
<p>
Are asleep in their innumerable dens and night haunts
</p>
<p>
Amid the dry ferns, in the tender nests
</p>
<p>
Pressed into shape by the breasts of the Mother birds?
</p>
<p>
How shall we simulate the thrill of announcement
</p>
<p>
When lake after lake lingering in the starlight
</p>
<p>
Turn their faces towards you,
</p>
<p>
And are caressed with the salutation of colour?
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
How shall we transmit in tendril-like images,
</p>
<p>
The tenuous tremor in the tissues of ether,
</p>
<p>
Before the round of colour buds like the dome of a shrine,
</p>
<p>
The preconscious moment when love has fluttered in the bosom,
</p>
<p>
Before it begins to ache?
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
How often have we seen the even
</p>
<p>
Melt into the liquidity of twilight,
</p>
<p>
With passages of Titian splendour,
</p>
<p>
Pellucid preludes, exquisitely tender,
</p>
<p>
Where vanish and revive, thro' veils of the ashes of roses,
</p>
<p>
The crystal forms the breathless sky discloses.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
The new moon a slender thing,
</p>

Into the vast night.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Her own land and folk were afar,
</p>
<p>
She must have gone astray,

To be with her on the way.
</p>

<hr class="div">

<p>
I can feel the wind on the prairie
</p>
<p>
And see the bunch-grass wave,
</p>
<p>
And the sunlights ripple and vary
</p>
<p>
The hill with Crowfoot's grave,
</p>
<p>
Where he &#34;pitched off&#34; for the last time
</p>
<p>
In sight of the Blackfoot Crossing,
</p>
<p>
Where in the sun for a pastime
</p>
<p>
You marked the site of his tepee
</p>
<p>
With a circle of stones. Old Napiw
</p>
<p>
Gave you credit for that day.
</p>
<p>
And well I recall the weirdness
</p>
<p>
Of that evening at Qu'Appelle,
</p>
<p>
In the wigwam with old Sakimay,
</p>
<p>
The keen, acrid smell,
</p>
<p>
As the kinnikinick was burning;
</p>
<p>
The planets outside were turning,
</p>
<p>
And the little splints of poplar
</p>
<p>
Flared with a thin, gold flame.
</p>
<p>
He showed us his painted robe
</p>
<p>
Where in primitive pigments
</p>
<p>
He had drawn his feats and his forays,
</p>
<p>
And told us the legend
</p>
<p>
Of the man without a name,
</p>
<p>
The hated Blackfoot,
</p>
<p>
How he lured the warriors,
</p>
<p>
The young men, to the foray
</p>
<p>
And they never returned.
</p>
<p>
Only their ghosts
</p>
<p>
Goaded by the Blackfoot
</p>
<p>
Mounted on stallions:
</p>
<p>
In the night time
</p>
<p>
He drove the stallions
</p>
<p>
Reeking into the camp;
</p>
<p>
The women gasped and whispered,
</p>
<p>
The children cowered and crept,
</p>
<p>
And the old men shuddered
</p>
<p>
Where they slept.
</p>
<p>
When Sakimay looked forth
</p>
<p>
He saw the Blackfoot,
</p>
<p>
And the ghosts of the warriors,
</p>
<p>
And the black stallions
</p>
<p>
Covered by the night wind
</p>
<p>
As by a mantle.
</p>
</div>
<hr class="div">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
I remember well a day,
</p>
<p>
When the sunlight had free play,
</p>
<p>
When you worked in happy stress,
</p>
<p>
While grave Ne-Pah-Pee-Ness
</p>
<p>
Sat for his portrait there,
</p>
<p>
In his beaded coat and his bare
</p>
<p>
Head, with his mottled fan
</p>
<p>
Of hawk's feathers, A Man!
</p>
<p>
Ah Morris, those were the times
</p>
<p>
When you sang your inconsequent rhymes
</p>
<p>
Sprung from a careless fountain:
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
&#34;<i>He met her on the mountain,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
He gave her a horn to blow,</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
And the very last words he said to her</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Were, 'Go 'long, Eliza, go.'</i>&#34;
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
Foolish,&#8212;but life was all,
</p>
<p>
And under the skilful fingers
</p>
<p>
Contours came at your call&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Art grows and time lingers;&#8212;
</p>
<p>
But now the song has a change
</p>
<p>
Into something wistful and strange.
</p>
<p>
And one asks with a touch of ruth
</p>
<p>
What became of the youth
</p>
<p>
And where did Eliza go?
</p>
<p>
He met her on the mountain,
</p>
<p>
He gave her a horn to blow,
</p>
<p>
The horn was a silver whorl
</p>
<p>
With a mouthpiece of pure pearl,
</p>
<p>
And the mountain was all one glow,
</p>
<p>
With gulfs of blue and summits of rosy snow.
</p>
<p>
The cadence she blew on the silver horn
</p>
<p>
Was the meaning of life in one phrase caught,
</p>
<p>
And as soon as the magic notes were born,
</p>
<p>
She repeated them once in an afterthought.
</p>
<p>
They heard in the crystal passes,
</p>
<p>
The cadence, calling, calling,
</p>
<p>
And faint in the deep crevasses,
</p>
<p>
The echoes falling, falling.
</p>
<p>
They stood apart and wondered;
</p>
<p>
Her lips with a wound were aquiver,
</p>
<p>
His heart with a sword was sundered,
</p>
<p>
For life was changed forever
</p>
<p>
When he gave her the horn to blow:
</p>
<p>
But a shadow arose from the valley,
</p>
<p>
Desolate, slow and tender,
</p>
<p>
It hid the herdsmen's chalet,
</p>
<p>
Where it hung in the emerald meadow,
</p>
<p>
(Was death driving the shadow?)
</p>
<p>
It quenched the tranquil splendour
</p>
<p>
Of the colour of life on the glow-peaks,
</p>
<p>
Till at the end of the even,
</p>
<p>
The last shell-tint on the snow-peaks
</p>
<p>
Had passed away from the heaven.
</p>
<p>
And yet, when it passed, victorious,
</p>
<p>
The stars came out on the mountains,
</p>
<p>
And the torrents gusty and glorious,
</p>
<p>
Clamoured in a thousand fountains,
</p>
<p>
And even far down in the valley,
</p>
<p>
A light re-discovered the chalet.
</p>
<p>
The scene that was veiled had a meaning,
</p>
<p>
So deep that none might know;
</p>
<p>
Was it here in the morn on the mountain,
</p>
<p>
That he gave her the horn to blow?
</p>

<p>
Tears are the crushed essence of this world,
</p>
<p>
The wine of life, and he who treads the press
</p>
<p>
Is lofty with imperious disregard
</p>
<p>
Of the burst grapes, the red tears and the murk.
</p>
<p>
But nay! that is a thought of the old poets,
</p>
<p>
Who sullied life with the passional bitterness
</p>
<p>
Of their world-weary hearts. We of the sunrise,
</p>
<p>
Joined in the breast of God, feel deep the power
</p>
<p>
That urges all things onward, not to an end,
</p>
<p>
But in an endless flow, mounting and mounting,
</p>
<p>
Claiming not overmuch for human life,
</p>
<p>
Sharing with our brothers of nerve and leaf
</p>
<p>
The urgence of the one creative breath,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
All in the dim twilight&#8212;say of morning,
</p>
<p>
Where the florescence of the light and dew
</p>
<p>
Haloes and hallows with a crown adorning
</p>
<p>
The brows of life with love; herein the clue,
</p>
<p>
The love of life&#8212;yea, and the peerless love
</p>
<p>
Of things not seen, that leads the least of things
</p>
<p>
To cherish the green sprout, the hardening seed;
</p>
<p>
Here leans all nature with vast Mother-love,
</p>
<p>
Above the cradled future with a smile.
</p>
<p>
Why are there tears for failure, or sighs for weakness,
</p>
<p>
While life's rhythm beats on? Where is the rule
</p>
<p>
To measure the distance we have circled and clomb?
</p>
<p>
Catch up the sands of the sea and count and count
</p>
<p>
The failures hidden in our sum of conquest.
</p>
<p>
Persistence is the master of this life;
</p>
<p>
The master of these little lives of ours;
</p>
<p>
To the end&#8212;effort&#8212;even beyond the end.

<p>
Here, Morris, on the plains that we have loved,
</p>
<p>
Think of the death of Akoose, fleet of foot,
</p>
<p>
Who, in his prime, a herd of antelope
</p>
<p>
From sunrise, without rest, a hundred miles
</p>
<p>
Drove through rank prairie, loping like a wolf,
</p>
<p>
Tired them and slew them, ere the sun went down.
</p>
<p>
Akoose, in his old age, blind from the smoke
</p>
<p>
Of tepees and the sharp snow light, alone
</p>
<p>
With his great grandchildren, withered and spent,
</p>
<p>
Crept in the warm sun along a rope
</p>
<p>
Stretched for his guidance. Once when sharp autumn
</p>
<p>
Made membranes of thin ice upon the sloughs,
</p>
<p>
He caught a pony on a quick return
</p>
<p>
Of prowess and, all his instincts cleared and quickened,
</p>
<p>
He mounted, sensed the north and bore away
</p>
<p>
To the Last Mountain Lake where in his youth
</p>
<p>
He shot the sand-hill-cranes with his flint arrows.
</p>
<p>
And for these hours in all the varied pomp
</p>
<p>
Of pagan fancy and free dreams of foray
</p>
<p>
And crude adventure, he ranged on entranced,
</p>
<p>
Until the sun blazed level with the prairie,
</p>
<p>
Then paused, faltered and slid from off his pony.
</p>
<p>
In a little bluff of poplars, hid in the bracken,
</p>
<p>
He lay down; the populace of leaves
</p>
<p>
In the lithe poplars whispered together and trembled,
</p>
<p>
Fluttered before a sunset of gold smoke,
</p>
<p>
With interspaces, green as sea water,
</p>
<p>
And calm as the deep water of the sea.
</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>
There Akoose lay, silent amid the bracken,
</p>
<p>
Gathered at last with the Algonquin Chieftains.
</p>
<p>
Then the tenebrous sunset was blown out,
</p>
<p>
And all the smoky gold turned into cloud wrack.
</p>
<p>
Akoose slept forever amid the poplars,
</p>
<p>
Swathed by the wind from the far-off Red Deer
</p>
<p>
Where dinosaurs sleep, clamped in their rocky tombs.
</p>
<p>
Who shall count the time that lies between
</p>
<p>
The sleep of Akoose and the dinosaurs?
</p>
<p>
Innumerable time, that yet is like the breath
</p>
<p>
Of the long wind that creeps upon the prairie
</p>
<p>
And dies away with the shadows at sundown.
</p>
</div>
<hr class="div">
<div class="stanza">
<p>
What we may think, who brood upon the theme,
</p>
<p>
Is, when the old world, tired of spinning, has fallen
</p>
<p>
Asleep, and all the forms, that carried the fire
</p>
<p>
Of life, are cold upon her marble heart&#8212;
</p>
<p>
Like ashes on the altar&#8212;just as she stops,
</p>
<p>
That something will escape of soul or essence,&#8212;
</p>
<p>
The sum of life, to kindle otherwhere:
</p>
<p>
Just as the fruit of a high sunny garden,
</p>
<p>
Grown mellow with autumnal sun and rain,
</p>
<p>
Shrivelled with ripeness, splits to the rich heart,
</p>
<p>
And looses a gold kernel to the mould,
</p>
<p>
So the old world, hanging long in the sun,
</p>
<p>
And deep enriched with effort and with love,
</p>
<p>
Shall, in the motions of maturity,
</p>
<p>
Wither and part, and the kernel of it all
</p>
<p>
Escape, a lovely wraith of spirit, to latitudes
</p>
<p>
Where the appearance, throated like a bird,
</p>
<p>
Winged with fire and bodied all with passion,
</p>
<p>
Shall flame with presage, not of tears, but joy.
